## Reflection

*learned*: 

-how Tableau relationships differ from joins, and how multiple clauses ensure accurate linking.  
-Publishing to Tableau Public showed me how to share interactive dashboards.  
-will be usefull in healthcare: similar dashboards could track admissions trends, imaging turnaround times, readmission rates, etc.
