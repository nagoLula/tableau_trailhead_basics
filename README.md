## Reflection

I learned how Tableau relationships differ from joins, and how multiple clauses ensure accurate linking.  
Publishing to Tableau Public showed me how to share interactive dashboards.  
In healthcare, similar dashboards could track admissions trends, imaging turnaround times, or readmission rates, supporting workflow optimization and patient‑centered initiatives.
